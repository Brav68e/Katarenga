BASIC RULES
• Players take turns moving one of their pawns.
• Captures are forbidden throughout the game.

OBJECTIVE
The goal is to form a connected block with all your pawns.

WIN CONDITION
A player wins when all their pawns form a connected group where:
• Each pawn is orthogonally adjacent (horizontally or vertically)
  to at least one other of their own pawns.
• All pawns are thus linked together, forming a compact block.
